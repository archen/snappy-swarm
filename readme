Docker Swarm for Snappy!

https://github.com/docker/swarm

Build with:
snappy build package-dir

Copy the resulting snap package into your snappy instance and install it:
snappy install swarm_XXXXX_amd64.snap

or using snappy-remote:
snappy-remote --url=ssh://X.X.X.X:YYYY install ./swarm_XXXXX_amd64.snap

NOTE you will have to modify /apps/docker/current/etc/docker.conf to contain:
DOCKER_OPTIONS="-H 0.0.0.0:2375"
and either reboot or manually restart the docker service.

All of the swarm commands are "shortcutted" to swarm.[cmd] to play nice with Snappy's $pkgname.$binary requirement. So, instad of having to type:
swarm.swarm create

You can use:
swarm.create
